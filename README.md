<h1>Shiplist Formatting Tool</h1>

This program takes a .txt file of Million Year Picnic's comic shiplist and formats it in proper HTML to be uploaded to [Million Year Picnic's site,]([url](https://www.themillionyearpicnic.com/)) on which I am an intern.

Holds the following functions of note:
<ul><li><b>editor</b>, which finds the title line and modifies it to include the proper formatting.</li>
<li><b>random_add</b>, which inserts the HTML that I use for featured comics on six random comic titles.</li>
<li><b>next_wednesday</b>, which determines the closest Wednesday (AKA: when the comics come out) and formats the title to include it.</li>
<li><b>runFile</b>, which takes the given .txt file, runs all of the above programs on it, and spits out a newly-formatted text file along with the randomly selected titles so I can add their features easily.</li></ul>

This was mainly an exercise in efficiency. Overall, it's going to make my job much easier every week, so I am quite pleased!
